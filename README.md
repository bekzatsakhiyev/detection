# 📱 Permission-Based App Risk Classification

## 📝 Project Overview
This project utilizes a **neural network** to classify applications based on the permissions they request. The goal is to determine whether an app poses a **potential privacy risk** by analyzing requested permissions.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Synthetic Dataset Generation** – Simulates app permission requests for 1,000 samples.  
✅ **Binary Classification** – Labels apps as **risky (1)** or **not risky (0)** based on permission thresholds.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Uses **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.  
✅ **Neural Network Model** – Implements a **feedforward neural network** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
✅ **Overfitting Prevention** – Includes **dropout layers** and **early stopping**.  
✅ **Performance Visualization** – Generates accuracy and loss plots.  
✅ **Prediction Analysis** – Evaluates model predictions with real vs. predicted labels.
